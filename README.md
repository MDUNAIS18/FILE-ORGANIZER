🚀 Automated File Organizer in Python
 Tired of messy, cluttered folders? I built a Python script that automatically scans, classifies, and organizes files based on their extensions — like Documents, Images, Videos, Audio, and more.
📁 From chaos to clean structure — all in seconds!
🔧 Key Features:
 ✅ Auto-categorizes files by type
 ✅ Dynamically creates folders
 ✅ Includes robust error handling & logging
 ✅ Fast, clean, and beginner-friendly
💡 Technologies used: Python, os, shutil, logging
💻 I developed this as part of my internship at Infotact Solutions, focusing on real-world automation using Python. This project sharpened my scripting skills and taught me the importance of clean, efficient solutions.
